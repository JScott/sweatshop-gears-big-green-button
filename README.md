# Big Green Button

This tool exists to provide a web interface to kick off Robot Sweatshop jobs. While `curl` works just fine, sometimes an easy to use button is appreciated.

## Usage

Run this script with the argument of the port number you want to bind to. It defaults to 8081

## Future

- Make the button big
- Make the button green
